#  TERM OF USE

These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the application and its associated services (collectively, the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not use the Service.

1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the Service, you confirm that you are legally able to enter into a binding contract and agree to comply with these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations.

2. Free Trials

Free trials may be offered at our sole discretion. Upon the conclusion of any applicable trial period, access to premium features will require a paid subscription unless otherwise specified.

3. Subscriptions and Payments

Subscriptions are offered on a recurring basis (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly, or as otherwise specified). Unless cancelled before the end of the current billing period, subscriptions will automatically renew for the same duration. You are responsible for managing your subscription through your deviceâ€™s App Store account settings. Subscription fees are charged to your account upon confirmation of purchase.

4. Cancellation and Refunds

Uninstalling the application does not cancel your subscription. To cancel, you must do so through the platform on which the subscription was initiated. Cancelled subscriptions remain active until the end of the current billing cycle. We do not offer refunds for unused portions of the subscription term.

5. Fee Changes

We reserve the right to modify subscription pricing at any time. Any changes will apply to future billing cycles and will not be applied retroactively.

6. Third-Party Services

The Service may integrate or utilize third-party services. We are not responsible for the content, availability, or performance of any third-party services, nor any loss or damage incurred from their use. For more information, please refer to our Privacy Policy.

7. Termination and Suspension

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is otherwise harmful to us or other users. We may also remove content and deactivate accounts at our sole discretion.

11. Amendments

We may revise these Terms at any time. Changes will be communicated via the app or our website. Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.
